        <h1 class="Bookmooch-h1">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>
        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading">About Project</h2>
        <p>BookMooch is an app that allows users to exchange and buy books from other app users. While it is possible to buy and borrow books online, through Amazon or library apps,
            book selection is limited by what is available. People buy a book that may not be of any use to them after reading it. But there may be another person who would like to read the same book. BookMooch aims to bring the sharing economy model to the lending, exchange and purchase of books as well.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p><span class="bolded">Reinvent Selling Experience</span><br>Selling and exchanging books in the app has never been smoother. It is an app for selling and buying used books, so selling books is one of the important tasks of the app and it must be a breeze so that users don't get confused when selling their books.<br>Break the problem into parts (define the different types of users, what actions the user can take and what this would lead to).<br>Come up with a comprehensive solution for different kinds of possible users of this application. Think about what elements you think should be on a given app screen and what the user journey would be.</p>
        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading">The Goal</h2>
        <p>Make books available to users even if they can't find the book to get.<br>
            Explore books around you efficiently <br>
            Easy communication between buyer and seller <br>
            To design a simple and easy-to-use app to help improve book exchange, selling and buying with Bookmooch.
        </p>
        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading">My role</h2>
        <p>I was the UI/UX Designer in charge of the project, my role included coming up with key deliverables such as Use research, User personas, User Flow, Wireframes, high-fidelity designs and a Clickable Prototype.</p>

        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading bmh">User Research</h2>
        <p class="bookmooch-p"><span class="green-text">Research Goal</span><br>I created a research plan and interview guide to provide insights into buyer behavior and attitudes towards online book exchange and purchase. Learning from the target audience and the services they use to buy and sell vintage books helped me understand their needs. What book lovers wanted to experience and the features they thought were necessary to sell or trade books was the main thing I wanted to know. Identifying opportunities, needs, pain points, and any other findings will help me shape the direction of the app's development.</p>
        <p class="bookmooch-p"><span class="green-text">User Interviews</span><br>In order to achieve the maximum result, I have created a list of common questions that I should ask all my users and three different sets of questions for each category of users. While talking to my participants, I realized that specific answers led me to ask questions from the other group. I conducted several interviews with users and asked the participants how often they find themselves in a similar situation and how they figure out that they are selling old books.</p>

        <p><span class="green-text">Affinity Mapping</span><br>After talking to potential users and noting their responses, I jotted them down and grouped them into an affinity map that helped me identify recurring themes and issues. I selected the most recurring themes or issues from the interviews to become the focal point of the mobile app.</p>

            The usability testing of my low-fidelity  prototype revealed some early user preferences. I collected both qualitative and quantitative data from my usability testing which allowed me to recognize that the first action most users took was scrolling down the home page. I kept this in mind when designing my high-fidelity prototypes by deeming the home page as prime real estate to convey the most important ideas in the quickest, most scannable way.

        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading">Takeaway</h2>
        <p>The journey of Bookmooch app UX project was incredible and filled with numerous learnings. These learnings are something that is always going to help me in my journey as a UI/UX designer. I learned that users always don’t know what they want, so it’s good to observe your user’s as much it is to listen to them. This will help you in creating realistic products. The design process is a great tool to help you design an excellent solution for users where even business goals are met. It is then very easy to create a misleading user flow and miss out on potential users.</p>
        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading">Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Follow a design process from research to iteration. <br>Process-driven design is the key to success. Taking constructive criticism with an open mind, fail fast to make immediate corrections, and iterate from feedback.</li>
            <li>Innovation comes from deep understanding and critical thinking; become obsessed with the user problem first and innovative solutions will follow.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2 class="Bookmooch-heading">Project Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Coming out with a design based on user research helped me understand a lot. So, luckily, I designed an interactive book finder app to make user’s life more delightful.</p>
        <p>I followed a light design style because I wanted the project to come off friendly and ultimately not give off a technical “database” vibe. Instead, the design will give users a familiar and delightful experience.</p>
